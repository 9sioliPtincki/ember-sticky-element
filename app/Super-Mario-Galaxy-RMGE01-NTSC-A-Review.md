## Some Tips and Tricks for Super Mario Galaxy RMGE01 NTSC
 
If you are playing Super Mario Galaxy RMGE01 NTSC for the first time, or if you want to improve your skills and discover some secrets, here are some tips and tricks that might help you:
 
- Collect as many star bits as you can. Star bits are the colorful pieces of stardust that you can find in every galaxy. You can use them to feed hungry Lumas, who will transform into new planets or stars. You can also use them to buy extra lives from a Luma shop, or to stun enemies and bosses. To collect star bits, you can either point at them with the Wii Remote, or spin near them.
- Explore every galaxy thoroughly. Each galaxy has multiple missions that you can access by selecting a Power Star on the observatory map. Some missions will take you to different parts of the galaxy, or change the layout or the gravity of the planets. Some missions will also have hidden Power Stars or Comet Medals that you can find by exploring off the beaten path. Comet Medals are special items that unlock Prankster Comet missions, which are harder versions of regular missions.
- Use the spin move wisely. The spin move is one of Mario's most useful abilities in this game. You can use it to attack enemies, break crates, activate switches, launch from star rings, and more. However, you can only spin once in midair, unless you touch a surface or an enemy. You also need to wait for the Wii Remote to vibrate before you can spin again. Be careful not to overuse the spin move, or you might run out of it at a crucial moment.
- Try different power-ups. Throughout the game, you will encounter various power-ups that will give Mario new abilities. For example, the Bee Mushroom will let Mario fly and stick to honeycombs, the Boo Mushroom will let Mario float and turn invisible, and the Fire Flower will let Mario throw fireballs. Each power-up has its own advantages and disadvantages, and some of them are required to complete certain missions. Experiment with different power-ups and see what they can do.
- Have fun with a friend. Super Mario Galaxy RMGE01 NTSC supports a two-player mode, where a second player can join in using another Wii Remote. The second player can control a star cursor on the screen, and help Mario by collecting star bits, stunning enemies, shooting star bits at enemies, or even stopping time for a few seconds. The second player can also point at Mario and press A to make him jump higher. Playing with a friend can make the game more fun and easier.

These are just some of the tips and tricks that you can use to enjoy Super Mario Galaxy RMGE01 NTSC even more. There are many more secrets and surprises waiting for you in this game, so don't be afraid to explore and experiment. Have fun!
